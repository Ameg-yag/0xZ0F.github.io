# FAQ:
**See [0x000-IntroductionAndSetup](0x000-IntroductionAndSetup) to see how the course is set up.**

**Q: How can I support you?**  
**A:** Aww, it's so nice of you to ask! You can support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/z0f) and I will love you forever :heart:.  
You can also support me by giving me feedback or advice. The best way to do this is on Twitter [@0xZ0F](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F).

**Q: When will the course be updated?**   
**A:** Whenever I can get around to it. This is a free course I'm making in my free time, so don't expect me to work 24/7.

**Q: Why are the courses written in Markdown (.md)?**   
**A:** Because it's easy to format things that look good. When I can get a chance, I'll provide PDF versions as well. Markdown files are best for viewing the course on GitHub and the PDFs are best if you decide to download the course to your computer. Markdown is also easy to read both when editing the text and viewing the product.

**Q: What's the file structure?**   
**A:** See "0x000 - Refreshing And HowTo".

**Q: Can I use the course for my own teaching?**  
**A:** Read the license: [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

**Q: Nothing is free, so why is this course?**  
**A:** Ye have little faith in humanity. Seriously, I am disappointed that so many security courses are expensive and/or don't teach enough. SANS and OffensiveSecurity courses are extremely expensive, but they are really good. That Indian guy on YouTube, his courses are free but don't cover enough.

**Q: If it's free, how do you make money doing this?**  
**A:** As of now, I don't. If you wish to support me or know how I get support, see the first question.

**A:** Yes, the content in the course is legal. However, it is possible to take the skills provided in this course and use them for bad purposes. I am not responsible for what you do with what you learn in this course.  
"With great power comes great responsibility".

**Q: How much time do you spend making this course?**

I do this course in my free time. I plan on keeping it up-to-date for the rest of my life.

**A:** Become a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/z0f) supporter.

**Q: Why are you constantly pushing your Patreon?**  
**A:** It's literally the only way I can make money. With that said...
