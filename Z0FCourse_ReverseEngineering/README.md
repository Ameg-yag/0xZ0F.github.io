## What We'll Do/Learn:
This course is going to teach anyone how to reverse engineer x64 Windows. We will start by covering some basics of binaries, then reverse some small samples, then move to a full program, the finally we will reverse a DLL and implement it into our own program. There will also be extra content at the end which will briefly cover other topics such as x86 and Linux.

## Important Notes:

THIS COURSE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! I'm nowhere near done, but feel free to watch the course develop over time! If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know on Twitter! If you would like to know a little of what I have planned, see the content inside of the [DOC](DOC) folder.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you forget what they mean, or don't know what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](Lingo.md).

## Why I Made This Course
Reversing is made so much harder because of the lack of resources to learn it. Most content is outdated, overpriced, hard to follow, or low quality. Reversing is already considered by many to be a difficult field to get into. Something being difficult isn't an issue, but when it gets needlessly difficult there is an issue. After reading multiple books, a dozen blog posts, going to multiple websites, following multiple YouTube "tutorials", and much more, I finally figured it out after months of work. I don't think it should be that hard to learn one topic. I certainly don't want people to have to go through the mess I went through, so I decided to make my own course. I love this field and I wanted to give back to the community. Here's my gift to you and the rest of the community. Hopefully there are a few people out there that this course can help.
