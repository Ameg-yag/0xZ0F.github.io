## Course Content
This course is meant to teach you about reverse engineering. We'll be focusing on 64 bit Windows. A majority of what you learn here will either carry over or help you with other architectures. I will briefly cover other architectures at the end as well.

Everything else you need to know is covered in [0x000-IntroductionAndSetup](0x000-IntroductionAndSetup). Have fun! :smile:
