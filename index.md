[RE Course - REVAMP SOON](/Z0FCourse_ReverseEngineering/README.md)

# Plan:

I'm working on a basic exploit development course as well.

# What About The "Old"/GitHub Courses?
I originally hosted these courses directly on GitHub. Here is my [reverse engineering course](https://github.com/0xZ0F/Z0FCourse_ReverseEngineering). I call those my "GitHub courses". I've copied these courses onto this website, these courses are called the "website courses". So what will I do now? I want to make the website the home of everything, so I want my website to become the primary source for my courses. If you want the most up-to-date version of the courses the website version will most likely be it. I will continue to update the GitHub courses.

# Support Me!
The courses take a long time to make, and I'm working on my own. As the courses get bigger and more complex they become harder to manage and make. On top of making the courses, I have real-life stuff going on. I try to make the courses as high quality, detailed, well structured, and easy to follow as I can. Unfortunately, there is only so much I can do. When working on these courses my motivation can die fast, which is why I need your help! It doesn't have to be money, it can be something as simple as following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F). If you do wish to support me monetarily, you can do so via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/z0f).
