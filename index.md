# Z0F - Research, courses, and more.

# ATTENTION:
The reverse engineering course is being moved back to GitHub. Maintaining the course on this website is much more difficult and annoying. 

# Plan:
!!! - The reverse engineering course is getting a revamp soon! I will be adding more detail as well as content.

I'm working on a basic exploit development course as well.

# Support Me!
The courses take a long time to make, and I'm working on my own. As the courses get bigger and more complex they become harder to manage and make. On top of making the courses, I have real-life stuff going on. I try to make the courses as high quality, detailed, well structured, and easy to follow as I can. Unfortunately, there is only so much I can do. When working on these courses my motivation can die fast, which is why I need your help! It doesn't have to be money, it can be something as simple as following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F). If you do wish to support me monetarily, you can do so via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/z0f).
