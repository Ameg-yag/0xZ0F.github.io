# WIP - This will become the home of my courses. I'm currently migrating the course onto this website. THERE WILL BE ISSUES! I'm working to get everything going, it should be done soon!

[RE Course](/Z0FCourse_ReverseEngineering/README.md)

# Plan:
Right now I'm migrating my reverse engineering course onto this website. Once that is done, I will finish the malware section. I will also migrate my other website ([https://www.z0fsec.tk/](https://www.z0fsec.tk/)) here. I'm not sure how I will integrate blog posts just yet.

I really want to start a binary exploitation and exploit development course (I don't know if I'll make two separate courses or not). I know that I should also add a chapter to the RE course based around reversing a real piece of software. I'm not sure which one I'll do first. My mind is racing about all the things I want to teach about binary exploitation, but it's probably best to add the chapter to the RE course.

# What About The "Old"/GitHub Courses?
I originally hosted these courses directly on GitHub. Here is my [reverse engineering course](https://github.com/0xZ0F/Z0FCourse_ReverseEngineering). I call those my "GitHub courses". I've copied these courses onto this website, these courses are called the "website courses". So what will I do now? For now, the GitHub courses will be my primary courses. When I feel like the GitHub version is in a good place I will copy, paste, and reformat them for this website. Because of this, the website version will be slightly behind the GitHub version as I make updates but it won't be an issue. The website should only be behind a few hours or at worst a few days.

# Support Me!
The courses take a long time to make, and I'm working on my own. As the courses get bigger and more complex they become harder to manage and make. On top of making the courses, I have real-life stuff going on. I try to make the courses as high quality, detailed, well structured, and easy to follow as I can. Unfortunately, there is only so much I can do. When working on these courses my motivation can die fast, which is why I need your help! It doesn't have to be money, it can be something as simple as following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xZ0F). If you do wish to support me monetarily, you can do so via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/z0f).
